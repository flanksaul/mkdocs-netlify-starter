# Code Review

## Standards

### When should a pull request be approved?

In general, reviewers should favor approving a pull request where:

- it is in a state where it definitely improves the overall code health of the system being worked on;
- where reasonable, all opportunities for training and consensus development have been taken and results captured;
- it fulfils the architectural ambitions and meets any standards, definitions of done, or the requirements of other checklists and processes;
- review has been appropriately thorough and the reviewer understands the changes;
- it has no easy-to-fix, clear and obvious errors without guaranteed remediation path;
- all comments have been acknowledged and appropriately addressed;
- all reasonable change requests have been addressed;
- all work arising from the review is captured; and
- no automated checks are failing.
